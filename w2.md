1) Fault localization involves identifying a **failing** test case, then working back from it to uncover an error somewhere in the program.

2) 
- Test cases are unbiased, meaning the code you write does not influence in the test cases. 
* Writing tests allow you to think about the code in greater depth, allowing for a more thought-out approach. 
+ Tests allow you to think about the requirements of your system.

Mutation testing refers to introducing intentional errors into a program, with the idea that unit test cases should now fail with the incorrect code. This provides more insight into the tests that have been written, as if they do not fail, then they clearly do not test all edge cases.
